Your website should have four webpages:
Home Page (See the requirements for the Home Page on your previous assignment).
* Navigation Bar and Footer should be based off the requirements on the previous assignment.
* Navigation bar should allow a user to navigate to all the different pages and be consistent on each individual page.
About
* Your About Page should have a description of the company in a few paragraphs, as well as images that help "tell a story".
* Paragraphs need to be real paragraphs, so no "lorem ipsum..." text can be used here.
Products (or Ideas Listing)
* List at least four products/ideas. Each one should be attached to an image, with some text attached to each one.
* products should be clickable, popping up a wrapper with that product's information showing and then being able to click off.
Contact
* Display different ways to contact the company:
* Use social media links.
* Create a fake contact box.
* Display fake emails.
Design Cleanliness:
* Mobile Friendly
* Color scheme is in harmony
* Readability
